						<h1 class="fontColor2 pt text-center">Fabian, A</h1>
						<p class="fontColor2 p1 size2">My name is Fabian and I was born and raised in Austin, TX. I've always wanted to learn to program but just never knew where to start. That's when a good friend of mine recommended FreeCodeCamp.</p>
						<p class="fontColor2 p1 size2"> I currently work for a software company as a technical support engineer so I am knowledegable about application servers (Tomcat & Weblogic), databases (ORACLE & MSSQL), ETL (Pentaho), XML, Webservices, and JAVA. </p>
						<p class="fontColor2 p1 size2">
							I'm really excited to finish this program by the end of 2018. I would like to become a full stack developer in order to continue my pursuit of knowledge and perhaps build my own web application one day or at least some really cool websites.
						</p>
						<p class="fontColor2 p1 size2">I recently purchased my first domain name and setup my original portfolio on Github. My goal is to ultimately setup my own local low power server on my home network and host my own site.</p>
						<p class="fontColor2 p1 size2">I relish the challenge of this upcoming project and the learning experiences that will allow to set new goals for myself as I continue with the program.</p>
						<p class="fontColor2 p1 size2">My short term goals are to obtain my Linux and ORACLE SQL Certifications so that I may become more proficient at my current job and concurrently advance my gaols of becoming a full stack developer.</p>
						<p class="fontColor2 p1 pt4 size2">Thank you for visiting my site.</p>
